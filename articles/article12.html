                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
               We live in a digital world where we can access to varieties 
of information and every application and machines are 
being automated with AI computer algorithms. These 
algorithms are used in various online applications like 
Ecommerce, Music, Video-Streaming etc, the main 
advantage of using ArtificiaI Intelligence in these fields 
helps businesses to gain profits by understanding the 
customer or user behaviour, understanding latest trends, 
incorporating best strategies into their applications to 
grow their business.
Recommender systems plays an important role in an 
online e-commerce websites and media streaming 
websites which are widely used where it helps to find 
the individual user interests and providing suggestions. 
Every recommendation system main goal is to provide 
personalized recommendation which is relevant to the 
user interest. 
These recommendations can be attained by different 
types of methods where every system works with an input 
to provide a definite output. Every business uses their own 
strategy which personalizes the recommendation system 
to understand the individual user-interest by different 
factors like age, gender, demographic location, past 
user interaction data etc, because there are more than 7 
million of people possessing different behaviour and it is 
little tricky to predict the exact behaviour but with these 
input factors we can assume that this type of users may 
have some similarities. For example, a new user has signed 
up to an online shopping application by not providing 
complete information. Being a new user there will be no 
past information which makes system to experience cold 
start problem which means not understanding which 
suggestion to be provided.
With the few interactions with the items the system 
recognizes the pattern and can provide suggestions with 
the help of Collaborative-filtering technique.
Ex. Being anonymous. By providing incomplete 
information to the recommender, it cannot be able to 
provide accurate suggestions and there are also several 
other factors which recommender system is affected like 
concept drift, data sparsity etc. Even though, the user 
doesn’t provide any input data, or effected by various 
factors the successful recommendation system has to 
provide suggestions precisely to user interest.

                <h2>Deep Learning in Recommender System</h2><br>
               Recently, deep learning is applied to recommender systems 
because these recommender systems are applied almost 
all the online websites which is having different types of 
data format. There are two types of data ie., structured 
and unstructured data mostly of the information available 
online. Structured data is textual data like reviews, tweets, 
gradings, ratings etc and unstructured data is image data 
like social posts, product images etc, it is impossible to 
draw suggestions for these types of information so deep 
learning models plays an important role for those types of 
recommender systems. Deep learning is typically regarded 
as a subfield of machine learning. 
Content Based Filtering
Based on the previous actions of the user or feedback 
given to the product/item, Content based filtering uses 
item features with which similar items or products are 
recommended.
Collaborative Filtering
This filtering finds similarities between users and items ie., 
user to user, item to item, item to user simultaneously to 
recommend the products to the user.
Hybrid Filtering
It is the combination of both content and collaborative 
filtering
Types of similarity measures: Using distance metric 
the similarities are identified and those are categorized 
relevant or irrelevant using distance. The distance can 
be calculated by using Minkowski distance, Manhattan 
distance, Euclidean distance, Cosine similarity, Pearson 
coefficient, Jaccard Similarity, Hamming distance.
Deep learning is commonly defined as learning 
deep representations or learning several levels of 
representations and abstractions from data. It improves 
a differentiable objective function using a stochastic 
gradient descent variation (SGD). Both supervised and 
unsupervised learning tasks have seen significant success 
using neural architectures. Some of the deep learning 
techniques are Multilayer perceptron, CNN (Convolutional 
Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), Auto 
Encoders, DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) etc.
Sequential recommendation system: 
These systems rely on traditional user-item rating ma

<p><h2>Sequential Recommedation System</h2> [4]:
These systems rely on traditional user-item rating matrix 
as an input. The goal is to predict immediate next user-
item or point of interest that user will interact from the 
time stamped rating matrix of sequence of events in data.


</p><br>
<p><h2>Session - Based Recommendation System</h2>
This system predicts the next user action present on the 
ongoing interactions of current session. In this system 
users are anonymous which deals with first time users or 
users who are not logged in. The input of these systems 
are recorded user interactions arranged according time ordered.

/p><br>
<p><h2>Session-aware Recomendation System</h2>
This system is also known as personalized session based 
because the main goal is also identical but users are 
known in this system, ex: users who are logged in. In this 
system recommendations are personalized with user past 
behaviour which can be beneficial for accuracy.
Several researches were conducted to understand 
what represents the state-of-the-art by evaluating 
different neural approaches. Comparisons were made by 
comparing newly proposed session-aware with existing 
session-based models which do not use a consistent set 
of baseline algorithms, so still research is scattered. The 
main idea is to combine the user’s long term and short 
term intents which can relate to the better accurate 
suggestion so we have compared five recent neural 
models like HGRU4REC,IIRNN(Inter-session and Intra-
session Recurrent Neural Network),SHAN(Sequential 
Recommender System based on Hierarchical 
Attention Network),NCSF, NSAR(Neural Session-Aware 
Recommendation)with set of existing neural and non-
neural approaches to session based and heuristic 
extensions like Extend, Boost and Remind of session based 
techniques which uses interactions in ongoing sessions. 
Nearest neighbors in session based are also used because 
they are very competitive. 
Four datasets Cosmetics, Lastfm, Retail, Xing which are 
publicly available were considered in this experiment. 
Surprisingly, heuristic extensions of existing session-based 
algorithms were best performing. In many cases nearest 
neighbors outperform recent session aware models 
although they do not use long term users intents.
With the analysis of several neural, non-neural and 
nearest neighbors baseline results, the session aware 
which combines users’ long term and short-term intents 
can be able to provide accurate suggestions if they were 
developed and still has huge potential to be state-of-the-
art in predicting next user item interaction.
