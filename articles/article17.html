                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
                E-commerce is growing exponentially with companies 
going ahead with digital-first mindset and with more and 
more players entering into this segment, the competition 
is immense. However, businesses that understand 
personalization are the ones growing at an accelerated 
rate by creating engaging human connections. Creating 
unique experiences for large audiences isn’t easy. 
Implementing personalization at scale is complex, 
involving transformation of your data, content, teams, 
and technology. But the effort is necessary, given 80% 
of B2C customers and 84% of B2B customers feel that 
personalization saves them time by making it easier to 
find information and settle decisions.
            </p><br>
            <p id="dive">
                <h2>Example</h2><br>
                The target is to enable marketers and sales to deliver and 
optimize highly personalized experiences on any website 
through recommendations and personalization. To serve 
the most appropriate content and offers to audiences 
based on contextual data such as user browsing, search, 
and product purchase history. To provide an omni-
channel solution that improves the visitor experience on 
any surface or screen customers engage with, including 
websites, native mobile apps, set-top boxes, kiosks, and 
more.

Personalized Recommendations uses a combination of 
sophisticated algorithms to develop recommendations 
for individual users. Among these are Item-Item 
Collaborative Filtering, which uses a novel similarity 
metric that corrects for popularity bias and allows for the 
exploration of long-tail items in recommendations. We 
also use content-based similarity algorithms that produce 
recommendations purely based on the descriptions of 
items in your product catalogues, with precise controls 
allowing you to tune the relative importance of different 
words to produce exactly the recommendations you 
want. Finally, we use popularity-based algorithms that 
recommend items based on top viewed, top purchased, 
and top viewed items among users who share a profile 
attribute, and others.
In addition to above, the apps has to run A/B tests that 
optimise the overall website experience for all customers. 
It helps business owners understand their customers and 
chose the best workflow for them.
The journey doesn’t end on the website, it continues even 
after the website visit through SMS, emails and in-app 
notification campaigns.

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p id="references"><br>
                    Campaign is a cross-channel marketing campaign 
management solution that enables organizations 
to  bring customer data from different systems, devices, 
and channels into a single profile and deliver timely 
and relevant campaigns to these customers. With this, 
companies can understand and define unique customer 
segments and then craft multi-step, cross-channel campaigns that make meaningful connections with each 
customer.
                </p>
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <h2>Managing Data</h2>
                <p id="data"><br>
                   All of the above has to deal with giga bytes of user’s 
data. Profiles built from streaming data collection. The 
following can help with managing the data.
 Enriched, privacy-ready consumer and account 
profiles update automatically based on behavioural, 
transactional and operational data without manual 
data stitching.
 Data collected from across channels and systems is 
normalised into a standard taxonomy.
 Tag management and event forwarding manage data 
in real time.
 Data privacy and security is very important. Patented 
data governance framework ensures customer 
privacy and preferences, enables compliance with 
internal and external policies and gives role-based 
access to teams across the enterprise.
 Live preview of user’s data helps 
businesses deliver latest recommendations.
And at the end we need a Holistic reporting which helps 
marketers to understand the impact of their campaigns 
so that they can create better experiences for their 
customers in the future.
The campaign reporting feature must facilitates the 
creation of dynamic reports to analyse the success of your 
campaigns in the real time. Depending on the complexity 
of your queries and calculations, the data must be 
aggregated into a list view or accessed in a format that 
makes it easy to generate marketing analytics reports.
I know all this is a lot to churn but great businesses go 
to any extent to provide great experiences to their 
customers. We at Adobe has all features mentioned above 
so that businesses can tailor their customer experience 
using Adobe experience cloud.
