                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
               Algorithms are step-by-step instructions for solving a 
particular problem. If your algorithm involves significant 
amounts of input data, complex operations, or both, 
you need to build clever algorithms that computers 
can process quickly. The myth is that we do not need 
algorithms for aspirants to become software developers 
and full-stack engineers. We can use existing face 
recognition algorithms, Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, 
and external libraries to solve real-time problems. 
However, MAANG companies like Google use tailor-
made shortest path algorithms to find the shortest 
path between source and destination for Google maps. 
Similarly, Meta uses sophisticated algorithms for friend 
recommendations on Facebook. Hence, we must adjust 
the existing library or build code from scratch. It is not 
correct to judge a candidate by technology or language 
ability. Therefore, big companies prefer asking algorithms 
questions rather than technology or language. Algorithms 
help test the quality of candidates. Adapt specific solutions 
to specific situations through new approaches to newly 
seen problems and confidently present solutions to teams 
with different perspectives.
In computer science, data (treated as singular, plural, or 
mass nouns) is any sequence of one or more symbols. 
Digital data is data represented by a binary number system 
of 1s and 0s rather than an analog representation. In 
modern computer systems (since 1960), all data is digital. 
Data representing quantities, characters, or symbols on 
which a computer performs operations are stored and 
recorded in magnetic, optical, electronic, or mechanical 
recording media and transmitted in the form of digital 
electrical or optical signals. Digital data is often stored 
in relational databases, such as spreadsheets and SQL 
databases, and can generally be represented as abstract 
key-value pairs. Data structures can store different 
data types, such as numbers, strings, and other data 
structures. In computer science, a data structure is a data 
organization, management, and storage format typically 
chosen for efficient access to data. More specifically, a 
data structure is a collection of data values, relationships 
between them, and functions or operations that can be 
applied to data. This is the algebraic structure of data 
(Wikipedia). Algorithm designers must choose appropriate 
data structures to design efficient algorithms.
Algorithm design is a method or mathematical process 
for problem-solving and algorithm development.

                <h2>Dive</h2><br>
                Algorithm design is part of many solution theories in 
operations research, Dynamic programming, and the 
divide-and-conquer principle. Techniques for designing 
and implementing algorithmic designs are also known 
as algorithmic design patterns, and examples include the 
template-method pattern and the decorator pattern.
Resource efficiency is one of the most important 
considerations while designing algorithms (runtime, 
memory usage). Using the Big O notation, one may show 
how an algorithm’s run-time grows as the size of its input 
does.
Typical procedures for creating algorithms:
1. issue description
2. creation of a model
3. Information about the algorithm
4. constructing an algorithm
5. examining the algorithm’s accuracy
6. a review of the algorithm
7. application of an algorithm
8. program evaluation
9. preparing documentation

<p><h2>Algorithmic effectiveness</h2> [4]:
When developing a resolution to an issue, we frequently 
want to gauge how “quick” the solution is. Unfortunately, 
many factors influence how quickly your software runs. 
The hardware of your computer, the dataset you’re using, 
other applications running on it, and even the temperature 
of your room can all impact how quickly your program 
runs. Thus, while using timers to assess program speed is 
helpful, it is not necessarily a valid technique to contrast 
different implementations.
</p><br>
<p><h2>Big-O notation: Context</h2>
Big-O notation is a more theoretical method of comparing 
different algorithms. Big-O notation is a mathematical 
notion that provides a rough upper bound on how long 
an algorithm will take to execute based on the size of dataset it uses. Read this article if you’re curious about 
the notation’s precise definition. For the time being, the 
emphasis is on making the notation simple to comprehend 
and efficient to apply.
</p><br>
<p><h2>Big-O Notation</h2>
It is helpful to know what is vital and what is not essential 
before using Big O notation. There are a few guidelines to 
follow while using the notation:
1. Constants are not considered
2. the term with the most rapid growth is considered
Considering those guidelines, the following statements 
are equivalent:
O(90 * n)  O(n) 
O (0.231)  O(1) 
O(4*n2
 + 3n + 2)  O(n2
) 
O(n*log(n) + 5000 * n)  O(n * log(n))
In each example, constant values are changed to 1, and 
other smaller components are not considered.
</p><br>
<p><h2>The mathematical definition big-O is as follows</h2>
Let f(n) and g(n) be positive functions, and let the set of 
functions be denoted by O(g(n)). f(n) is a member of the 
set O(g(n)) for which the ratio f(n)/g(n) remains below a 
constant c when n becomes very large.
Example #1: f(n) = 50n is O(n), as the ratio of f(n) to g(n) = 
n is always c=50.
Example #2: 4n-3 is also in O(n) because the ratio 
between f(n) = 4n - 3 f(n) = 3n2 and g(n) = n remains at 
or below c = 4.Z
</p><br>
<p><h2>Complexity Analysis:</h2>
What is the Time Complexity of the summation of n 
numbers?
Programmer perspectives:
Input: n
Output: 1+2+3+…+n
Algorithm #1: function summation(n) {
var sum = 0; 1 fundamental operation
for (var i = 1; i < n; i++) { n iteration
 sum = sum+i; 2 fundamental operation * n
 }
 return sum; 1 fundamental operation
Time Complexity: number of fundamental operations
Fundamental operations:
a+b, a-b, a×b, a÷b, a=b, return, bitwise operations, Comparision 
operations
Algorithm #1 has 2n+2 fundamental operations
Time Complexity: O(2/n+2/) implies O(n)
Algorithmic thinking perspective:
Input: n
Output: 1+2+3+…+n
Algorithm #2: function summation(n) {
return n * (n+1)/2; 4 fundamental op.
}
doesn’t depends on n
Four fundamental operations, independent of input size 
n, are required.
Consequently, the time complexity is: O (1)
Algorithm #1 has a time complexity of O(n), whereas 
Algorithm #2 has a time complexity of O (1).

<p><h2>Conclusion</h2>
CRUD applications require no algorithmic knowledge. 
However, in order to implement an innovative concept, 
we must design complex algorithms by modifying existing 
algorithms or from scratch. Thus, algorithms play a crucial 
role in developing innovative, cutting-edge products such 
as google maps, Amazon’s product recommendation 
system, and Netflix’s movie recommendation system.
