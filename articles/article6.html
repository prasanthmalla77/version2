                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
                The buzzword AI is an increasingly used term in today’s 
technological world. In the last decade, we have 
witnessed enormous growth in AI enabled applications 
like never before. At the start of last decade, the focus of 
Machine Learning (ML) applications was to tag or classify 
images and today we have ML algorithms that can even 
generate images (e.g. DALL-E 2). Similarly, a decade ago 
we started with applications that can predict sentiment 
of a user from movie reviews and today we have systems 
that can generate text and even fill parts of software code 
(e.g. Github Copilot).
<br>
Many ML practitioners consider the year 2012 as the 
breakthrough year for AI where they started to believe 
that deep learning models indeed work better than 
traditional ML methods. This success can be attributed 
to two important factors 1) the availability of large 
training datasets and 2) the availability of infrastructure to 
train large deep learning models. If you look at any ML 
problem setting in the real world, it has two main parts 
which are the core model part and the core data part. The 
core model part deals with designing models (say deep 
learning models), optimizers, coming up with suitable 
training schemes, validating and maintaining these trained 
models. As a result of this, we have witnessed a number 
of important technical developments on the core model 
part like improvements in Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNNs), Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), Generative 
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformer Models. On 
the other hand, talking about the core data aspect, apart 
from collecting huge datasets, very little or no emphasis 
is laid on the quality of the training data and managing it.
            </p><br>
 Many challenges that AI based applications face in the real 
world are due to imperfections in data. Imagine a scenario 
where you are developing an AI algorithm which is to be 
deployed in a real world application. To ensure that your 
AI algorithm works with extreme reliability, this algorithm 
has to be trained with data that contains even rarest of 
the rare situations that the application might encounter 
in the real world. Recently, Tesla’s autopilot feature had 
mistaken a horse carriage for a truck and this could be 
due to the long tailedness of the data (the ML model(s) 
deployed in autopilot may have encountered very few or 
no scenes containing horse carriage during training). This 
is why “Data-centric AI” is needed. Here, the focus is on 
collecting good quality training data and ensuring good 
quality labelling. This also includes ensuring good data 
coverage, which could be done through search, retrieval 
of rare instances, usage of data augmentations (selfsupervision) and synthetic data generation to generate 
rare scenarios or to fill domain gaps. This also includes 
methods to identify and handle data drifts post model 
deployment.
            </p><br>
            <p>
There is a saying that “Your model is as good as your data” 
and good quality data is a must to build any successful ML 
pipeline. As articulated by Andrew Ng in “MLOps: From 
Model-centric to Data-centric AI”, the future is moving 
towards Data-centric AI
