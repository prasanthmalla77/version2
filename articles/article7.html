                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2><br>
                For aspiring entrepreneurs, once the thought occurs 
about launching their own startup, they do not necessarily 
have a clear roadmap to manifest their thoughts into an 
action plan. In this paper, I will narrate my experience over 
the last two years that allowed my startup to take birth, 
and progress toward a product launch in the summer of 
2022 and landing a marquee client Google.
            <p id="BACKGROUND">
 <h2>BACKGROUND</h2><br>
In 2014, one of the iconic Silicon Valley networking 
companies hired my company to assist them with one 
of their channel partner incentive and rewards program. 
Numerous companies sell their products to end customers 
in two modes: 1) direct sellers – meaning that a company 
a has their own sales teams who sell the products and 
solutions to the end customers, and 2) indirect sales – 
selling through intermediaries, typically called channel 
partners. These channel partners interface with the end 
customers. The channel partners typically sell products 
and solutions from different companies. To ensure that 
a partner positions their products to a customer, the 
companies design a variety of incentives and rewards so 
that a partner is more engaged with them and that they 
position their product/solution to the end customer. 
In the case of the incentives program that my 
company was program managing, we were interfacing 
with a vendor who provided the software solution that 
managed the incentives and rewards for the individual 
partner sellers of a partner company. Over a course of 
several years, there was partner dissatisfaction on several 
fronts: 
1. The process of submitting a purchase order (PO) was 
error prone and the system could not find the PO 
because of syntax errors. As a result, they were not 
getting the rewards on time.
2. Partners opened support cases to resolve such 
issues. Since many POs were not processed 
automatically, the support cases began to grow 
rapidly, the resolutions times increased, and the 
partner dissatisfaction increased.
3. The technology and the software algorithms in 
essence were outdated. Some of the processes were 
manual and/or semi-automatic.
4. The company management was frustrated that 
partners were expressing their dissatisfaction, their 
engagement levels dropped, and the Return on 
Investment (ROI) was decreasing.
There was an opportunity for innovation, automation, 
and transformation. It was time to think about a new 
approach to solving these challenges. As an entrepreneur, 
I sensed an opportunity to solve a customer problem. We 
proposed a new state-of-art solution to address these 
challenges, enhance the system functionality, automate 
the process, and ensure a high level of partner satisfaction. 
Once approved, our team of almost twelve people 
designed, developed, and deployed a solution within 
nine months. The system went live in the first quarter of 
2019. Since then, our team supports an ecosystem of over 
25,000 partners.
            <p id="THE BEGINNING">
 <h2>THE BEGINNING</h2><br>
At the beginning of 2021, I decided to launch a new 
startup, Rewards cloud In The purpose of the startup is to develop a solution in the 
channel incentives and management to begin with. My 
team and I had acquired domain knowledge including a 
deep understanding of the still unresolved problems and 
potential for innovation and transformation. To commit 
to this new journey, we needed to first do due diligence 
about its feasibility. Afterall, it requires a commitment of 
time, money, and resources. The following is a high-level 
process that was followed to arrive at a decision. 
<h3>Collaborative research on channel partner 
ecosystem</h3>
First, I gathered an excellent team of trusted advisors 
who worked in the industry in the channel partner space. 
These advisors were pioneers and thought leaders who 
have defined and led numerous channel partner programs 
in their distinguished career. The team also included my 
technical leads who gained expertise because of the 
development of similar solutions. We took about one 
month to do focused research to understand the channel 
partner ecosystem and the various sub-categories 
embedded in it. We had a recurring meeting, and we had 
a shared folder to share our work in progress and our 
observations.
<h3>Collaborative research on incentives and rewards</h3>
A team was dedicated to researching the incentives 
and rewards landscape beyond the channel partner 
ecosystem. For example, there are many loyalty programs 
in industries such as air travel, hotels, and credit card 
programs. The purpose was to identify motivation factors 
that trigger people to act the way they do, and how we 
could use the theory of motivation to influence certain 
behavioral outcomes. This aspect of the research also 
lasted about a month.
<h3>Scoping the problem and the opportunity</h3>
The team evaluated the results of steps 1 and 2 
continuously. We identified numerous directions that 
we can take to develop the solution. For every direction 
suggested, we did a further evaluation of the product and 
solutions that are already in the marketplace. After an 
iterative process that lasted almost a month, we finalized 
the scope of the problem and the opportunity.
<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
Now came the critical task of doing a comprehensive 
competitive analysis. For an entrepreneur, this is a 
crucial step in the journey. There are several aspects to 
conducting a competitive analysis. The product that 
is envisioned must address an either an “unmet” need 
in industry, or perhaps identify a new and innovative 
way of solving existing problems. Once the scope was 
defined, the team dedicated itself to identifying about 
fifteen different vendors in the marketplace that address 
problems like what we were trying to solve 
in an innovative fashion.
<h3>Identifying the differentiators</h3>
This is yet another task that requires a deliberate and 
objective approach to ensure that we are embarking on 
the right journey. The differentiators must distinguish the 
startup from other competitors in such a way that once the 
product/solution is released the barrier to entry is set very 
high. It means that it will take a long time for competition 
to catch up. The team identified five differentiators, but 
we needed validate whether these were going to be true 
differentiators.
<h3>Expert evaluation of the differentiators</h3>
Through the contacts of our industry recognized 
advisors and our clients, we conducted several interviews 
to get valuable input on these differentiators. The 
experts helped us evaluate these differentiators multiple 
perspectives. The result was a more holistic way of 
combining these differentiators to create a powerful 
Partner Ecosystem platform that is beyond just the 
incentives and rewards management.
<h3>Making the Go/No Go decision</h3> 
This was the last step of the process. The entire team 
met for a final discussion where all the research, the 
methodology adopted, and the final conclusions were 
presented. After some passionate discussions, the team 
unanimously approved the decision to go to the next step 
of identifying the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that 
needs to be developed.
            <p id="THE MVP DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY">
 <h2>THE MVP DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY</h2><br>
The scoping of the problem and the opportunity 
is at a broader level as what we aim to achieve with our 
product/solution. In the dynamic product introductions 
in today’s world, it is important that startup products 
be introduced into the market quickly to ensure their 
competitive advantages. This implies that in general the 
product development lifecycle should be such that the 
new product is introduced in a reasonable timeframe. 
In our case, we determined and agreed that we should 
introduce our product within a year from the product 
development launch date. The business and the technical 
teams collaborated to first document a detailed list of 
the product requirements over a course of two weeks. 
The technical team further evaluated these requirements 
in terms of time estimates for completing those tasks. 
Through an iterative process we all agreed on the subset 
of the overall requirements that will be part of the first 
release of the product. It is a sufficient set of requirements 
encompassing the five key differentiators. This became 
our MVP.The MVP determined the team structure including the 
knowledge, skills, and experience required for different 
roles such as technical architect, UI/UX designer, frontend developer, back-end developer, DevOps engineer, 
Web Developer, Testing and QA lead, and technical 
project manager. Since our startup did not have all the 
required skills in house, we attempted to hire the right 
people but were not able to put together a good team 
on time. A strategic business decision was made to hire 
a technical consulting firm to provide us the necessary 
resource. The development started in earnest in the first 
week of June 2021.</P> 
<p id="THE CHALLENGES AND THE SOLUTIONS">
<h2>THE CHALLENGES AND THE SOLUTIONS</h2><br>
The development process had its own share of 
challenges that required very active people and process 
management. Some of the challenges that we faced 
include the following:
1. It was clear very early on that some of the back-end 
developers provided by the consulting company 
were not competent enough to meet our stringent 
standards of algorithm design and coding. They had 
to be replaced with substitutes which then resulted 
in a few weeks of delays in the development process. 
2. Some of the development team members provided 
by the consulting team company were not their direct 
employees. We noticed that their commitment levels 
and their motivation was not on par with the rest 
of team. As the overall leader of the team, I worked 
with the tech leads to device ways to motivate the 
team members go beyond the normal call of duty 
to achieve the development milestones in a timely 
manner. 
3. There was a crucial product demonstration meeting 
a highly influential analyst who agreed to review our 
product and mention it in his widely circulated report 
about the state-of-art I the channel partner domain. 
To meet this deadline, we had to overcome the 
above-mentioned challenges and inspire the team 
to step up to the challenge. This entailed working 
through the weekends and doing whatever it takes to 
succeed. We passed the analyst gate and eventually 
our product was included in the analyst’s report.
4. At the end of February 2022, we had a rude shock 
from the consulting company that the two critical 
back-end resources that the company hired through 
third parties will quit the project with one day notice. 
This essentially put the entire project in a jeopardy. 
Such delays would cost a startup precious time and 
significant money. Fortunately, we were able to solve 
the problem by hiring two better backend developers 
within a week and the development was back on 
track.
5. The MVP was finally delivered at the end of May 
2022 as we estimated. In the following three months, 
the teams focused on enhancing the security of 
the product so that it is compliant with the various 
Infosec standards in the industry.
<p id="LANDING A MARQUEE CLIENT">
<h2>LANDING A MARQUEE CLIENT</h2><br>
During the journey, the team gave numerous demos 
through a combination of prototype/interactive mockups 
to several companies. This allowed us to get valuable 
feedback from prospective clients. One client, Google, 
saw our demo and got insights into how we developed 
the solution for the networking client. They signed us up 
to implement their customized solution. Our team got 
onboarded and withing six months, we hope to deploy 
the custom solution.
<p id="CONCLUSIONS">
<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2><br>
The journey continues. The team finalized the 
requirements for the next phase of the product. This article 
aims to shed light on what it takes for an entrepreneur to 
bring a product to life once they get a small idea and they 
start dreaming big about the changing the world. The 
article did not touch upon the other important aspects of 
such a journey. Most importantly, it does not present the 
approach to financing the product development. In our 
case, we had a paying client that generated positive cash 
flow. In addition, as a founder of the company, I invested 
my personal funds into this effort. For more details about
