                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
                Landing the job you want isn’t always a straightforward 
process. Everything from spellbinding your resume to 
exhilarating your interviewers can be challenging and 
completely nerve-racking. Top companies not only look 
for people who work hard but people with a positive 
attitude. Always come up with a great story that speaks to 
your dedication, hard work and perseverance. And you’ve 
heard it before, because it’s true: “Communication is key”, 
always try to be proactive and express your interest, this 
mantra will definitely place you in great hands.
Being a fresher, you need to get your foot in the door. A 
generic resume isn’t likely going to do it, no matter how 
polished it looks. So make sure it lines up with the job 
description, because any communication to the hiring 
managers should be very clear in a way you’re a fit for the 
role.
Finally, are you juggling around the interview process? 
Here is the life saver: “Always make coding your priority”. 
There are many platforms available to enhance your 
coding skills like Leetcode, HackerRank etc. You can’t just 
go with the last few days of preparation to companies like 
Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Your learning should be 
a continuous process. The better you are with your core
knowledge, the best you will get.
Speaking out your thoughts to interviewers makes a big 
difference. Sometimes you might not solve the problem 
as expected but might end up with a job. Sounds weird 
right? But it’s true. These days all top companies are 
looking not only for problem solving skills, but also expect 
you to communicate your thoughts. Remember, they 
mainly focus on your approach to the problem which can 
be achieved only by putting your thoughts out. 
Your best bet to improve your skills is collaborative 
programming using shared environments in real-time with 
your friend or colleague by sharing each other’s thoughts 
and solving problems together. Don’t be discouraged if 
you can’t solve it in the first go. Keep trying, the more the 
merrier. It always takes hard work to achieve something 
important.
