                Faculty in the Dept. of Information Technology at JNTUGV, College of Engineering, Vizianagaram.

            </p><br><br><br>
                The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of 
physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with 
sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose 
of connecting and exchanging data with other devices 
and systems over the internet..<br><br>
                                                    
                  IOT has many applications in the real world and the 
automated wheelchair is one of the example for its 
applications..<br><br>
            This automated wheelchair enables users such as 
physically challenged people to move from one place 
another place. It helps the users to move of their own 
without any other persons involvement.<br><br>
         The instruction can be given through the application 
and the application is developed in such a way that the 
instruction can be given both in text and audio format so 
that both blind and physically disabled person can use 
the service. Currently some automated wheelchairs are 
available in the market but we have to operate the wheel 
chair to travel from one destination to another destination 
but the automated wheel chair that we have designed will 
drive automatically once we fixed the destination like a Tesla car.

                <h2>Sensor</h2><br>
                A sensor is a device that detects input of any kind from 
the physical world and reacts to it. Light, heat, motion, 
moisture, pressure, and a variety of other environmental 
phenomena can all be inputs. The output is typically a 
signal that is translated into a display that can be read by 
humans at the sensor location or that is electronically 
sent over a network to be read or put through more processing
            </p><br>
            <p id="dive1">
                <h2>Object Recognition</h2><br>
                Object detection determines whether or not an object 
is visible in a picture. It establishes its position within the 
frame. Although the algorithm utilised to do this task is 
rather straightforward, it yields effective results. Sensors 
collect data according to the IoT standard. Instead of 
sending data across the network or to the cloud, it is more 
effective to process this continuous stream of data (such 
as from a video camera) on the sensors<br><br>
     Cameras carry out object detection along with related 
activities like object classification and counting. The 
device’s efficiency is increased by performing this 
preprocessing work locally because extra network traffic
            </p><br>
             <p id="dive2">
                <h2>Localization</h2><br>
                One of the most alluring IoT applications is localization-
based services. They are actually able to gather and send 
data in order to pinpoint the location of the target because 
of the deployment of sensor networks. The literature has 
numerous localization system proposals.
         </p><br>
        <p id="dive3">
                <h2>Path planning:</h2><br>
                Any autonomous mobile robot must perform path 
planning in order to determine the best free path from 
a given starting place to a specified objective. In this 
work, a novel approach based on the internet of things 
(IoT) has been developed; robot platforms are employed 
for path following, while microprocessor-based gadgets 
are used for path development. In order to construct 
a hybrid technique using fixed cell decomposition for 
the environment and create a map of this environment, 
two separate algorithms, Bug0 and Potential Field, are combined.
         </p><br>
            <p id="dive4">
                <h2>Actuation:</h2><br>
                A physical object (“thing”) plus a controller (“brain”), 
sensors, actuators, and networks make up an Internet of 
Things device (Internet). A machine component or system 
known as an actuator moves or controls a mechanism or 
a system. The device’s sensors gather information about 
its surroundings, and control signals are then created for 
the actuators in accordance with the activities that must be taken.<br><br>
      An actuator is something like a servo motor. They can 
move to a defined angular or linear location and can be 
either linear or rotatory actuators. To meet our needs, we 
can employ servo motors in IoT applications to rotate the 
motor by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, etc.
         </p><br>
          </p><br>
            <p id="dive5">
                <h2>Detailed maps:</h2><br>
                The process of mapping involves obtaining geographic 
data such that the user may interpret latitude, longitude, 
depth, and other dimensions to represent the positions 
of objects and, optionally, their qualities (such as roads or 
towers). There are a wide range of potential uses for maps, 
including in the fields of urban planning and navigation. 
The application of mapping technology is possible in a 
variety of industries, including media and entertainment, 
construction, the healthcare sector, and others.
