                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
                Machine learning (ML) [1] and data science (DS) are two 
                important dominating fields in recent days in the area of 
                computer science and information technology. They are 
                increasingly used as effective and efficient tools for solving 
                all most all problems occurring in every sphere of life. The 
                dramatic growth of algorithmic decision making under 
                the umbrella of machine learning and decision science 
                continues to gain momentum in marketing, research in 
                this stream is still inadequate despite the devastating, 
                asymmetric and oppressive impacts of algorithmic bias 
                on various customer groups. There are advantages to 
                algorithmic decision-making; unlike human, ML and DS 
                agents does not become tired. However, like human, 
                ML and DS agents are vulnerable to discrimination that 
                renders its decisions ‘‘unfair”. Discrimination is the unfair 
                treatment of individuals based on specific characteristics, 
                also called sensitive features such as gender and race. 
                It has been found that machine learning not only leads 
                to unexpected results with bias, but also has amplified 
                algorithmic bias. Extensive studies have been conducted 
                to achieve the fairness in ML and DS model, and generally 
                categorized in three approaches: preprocessing, in-
                processing and post-processing. Pre-processing solves 
                the problem by eliminating the bias present in the training 
                data itself. In-processing reduces the bias by adding a 
                constraint to the learning algorithm even if there is a bias 
                in the data. Postprocessing ensues decisions themselves. 
                Readers may refer [2] for more details on algorithmic bias. 
                Now we will turn our attention to second part of our topic 
                of discussion i.e., multilabel classification.

                Multilabel classification, an equally important topic of ML 
and DS aims to build classification model for instances 
assigned with multiple-labels simultaneously which is a 
common learning paradigm in real world application [3]. It 
deals with multiple labels being assigned to every instance 
in a dataset which can be assigned to more than one class 
simultaneously. Multi-label classification tasks exist in 
many real-world applications, such as, gene classification 
in bioinformatics[2], medical diagnosis, document 
classification, music annotation, image recognition, and 
so on. All these applications require effective and efficient 
multilabel classification algorithms. There exist a variety 
of multilabel classification algorithms[3]. The existing 
multilabel classification algorithms are developed based 
on two basic approaches like algorithm adaptation and 
problem transformation method. Problem transformation 
method is to transfer multi-label classifications into 
multiple traditional single label classifications, specifically, 
multiple binary classifications. After a multilabel 
classification problem is transferred into multiple 
binary classification problem then, all the traditional 
classification algorithms can be applied directly to build 
a classifier for each binary dataset and make prediction 
for its correlated test instances. For more details about 
multilable classification, readers may refer a tutorial 
authored by Gibaja and Ventura [3].
